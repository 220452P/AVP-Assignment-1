# AVP-Assignment-1

Objective of the assignment:
Apply C# programming knowledge such as OOP concept & Entity Framework in a scenario based console application. 

Scenario of the assignment: 
This assignment is to create a Pokemon Pocket console application to let pokemon player keep, view the pokemon they caught and check if they can evolve. 
If the pokemons in the pocket is ready to evolve, the player can evolve their pokemon characters. Each time when players caught a Pokemon, they can add 
the pokemon to this Pokemon Pocket program. The pokemon evolution criteria in this application are the simplified version which means that it could be
different from the actual game that you have played in the Pokemon App. 

The evolution of a pokemon here is based on the number of the same pokemon type that the player collected. The current program has 1 class object, 
PokemonMaster class with attributes that describe the evaluation criteria such as the name of the pokemon, number of the same pokemon character to 
be evolved and what it will evolve to.

This class has 3 objects â€“ Pikachu, Eevee and Charmander. 
Create a Pokemon class and implement subclasses for the 3 pokemons. 
This means that the players can only add these 3 pokemon characters to the pocket. You can add more pokemon subclasses to make your program more interesting if you want to. 
The Pokemon class should have the following attributes:  
 - Name of Pokemon
